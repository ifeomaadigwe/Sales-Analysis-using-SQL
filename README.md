# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL
This repository contains an analysis of sales data from a supermarket. The data was obtained publicly online and contains information about the branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, gross margin, shopping time, shopping date, payment method, gross income, and customer rating for each sale.

The aim of this analysis was to gain insights into the performance of the supermarket, including identifying the most popular product lines, the most profitable branches, and the distribution of customer ratings.

The analysis was performed using SQL, with the data stored in a relational database. SQL queries were used to extract and manipulate the data, and the results were visualized using [insert visualization tool], which are included in this repository.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of the supermarket and could be used to inform business decisions and strategy. The SQL code used to perform the analysis is included in this repository, along with a README file explaining how to replicate the analysis.
